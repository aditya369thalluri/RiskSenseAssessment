Assumptions:
1. Input strings in the array are Case-Sensitive.
2. We just need to build a hashmap and return it.

Algorithm:
1. Intialize a hashmap to store the counts.
2. For every string in the input array,
	a) If it already exists in the map, increment its count by 1.
	b) Else add it to the hashmap with count 1.
3. Return the hashmap.


Complexity:
1. Assuming there are n strings in the given array, the time complexity of function will be O(n).
