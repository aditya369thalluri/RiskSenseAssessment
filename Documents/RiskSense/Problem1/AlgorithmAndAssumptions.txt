Assumptions:
1. Only one row for each manufacturer in the output.
2. When there are multiple models from a same manufacturer with highest price, then we select one model from that manufacturer.

Algorithm:
1. Firstly, write a query to find out the highest price for each manufacturer as pairs (manufacturer, price).
2. Using the above result as Sub-query, Find the triplets for each manufacturer as (manufacturer, model, price) with the highest price.
3. Use Distinct on manufacturer, so that we get only one entry per manufacturer in case of multiple models with highest price.


Complexity:
1. Assuming there are n rows in the table, the time complexity of query will be O(n).
